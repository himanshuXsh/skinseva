# 🥼 Why FaceAI?

FaceAI is designed to help early diagnosis of common facial skin diseases through AI-powered image analysis.

✅ Early Detection: Diagnose skin conditions faster, reducing late-stage complications.  
✅ AI-Powered: Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transfer Learning.  
✅ Real-World Application: Targeted for rural healthcare, telemedicine, and mobile diagnosis.  
✅ Scalable: Works with datasets of 10,000+ images and multiple disease classes.  
✅ Web Accessible: Simple upload-and-predict web portal.

# 📷 Dataset

We use a combination of dermatology image datasets including:

- DermNet Dataset (Public)
- HAM10000 Dataset (Kaggle)
- Custom Augmented Data for underrepresented diseases

Classes we focus on:
- Acne
- Eczema
- Psoriasis
- Vitiligo
- Melanoma

Dataset Stats:
- 10,000+ labeled face disease images
- Preprocessed to (224x224) size
- Balanced classes using Data Augmentation (rotation, flipping, zoom)

---

# 🧠 Our Model and Approach

We use deep learning (CNN) with Transfer Learning for high performance:

**Model Architecture:**  
- Base Model: ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- Fine-tuned final layers
- Softmax output for multiclass disease prediction

**Training Pipeline:**  
- Data Augmentation
- Early Stopping
- Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss
- Optimizer: Adam
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

---

# 🛠️ Tooling

- TensorFlow/Keras for Deep Learning
- OpenCV for Image Preprocessing
- Flask for Backend API (optional Streamlit for Web App)
- Firebase for Hosting
- Google Vertex AI (optional advanced hosting)

Utilities and Libraries:
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- scikit-learn for evaluation metrics

---

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Git
- Docker (optional for deployment)
- Firebase account (for hosting)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-disease-detection
cd face-disease-detection
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Locally

```bash
python app.py
```
Open browser at `http://localhost:5000`

---

# 💡 Use Cases

- **Telemedicine**: Offer remote skin disease diagnosis to rural patients.  
- **Hospitals/Clinics**: Pre-screen patients before dermatology appointments.  
- **Research**: Analyze large-scale skin disease datasets efficiently.  
- **NGOs**: Set up mobile diagnostic units using low-cost AI.

---

# 🛠️ Custom Model Extension

Want to extend FaceAI?

- Add more disease classes (e.g., Rosacea, Lupus).
- Train on higher resolution images (512x512).
- Build mobile version using TensorFlow Lite.
- Integrate with EHR (Electronic Health Records) systems.

---

# 🗝️ Accessing Model via API (Optional)

Example API Call to Upload Image:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5000/predict' \
  -F 'image=@/path/to/your/image.jpg'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "disease": "Eczema",
  "confidence": "93.45%"
}
```

---

# 🎨 Make FaceAI Your Own

- Customize Disease Labels
- Change the Model Architecture (EfficientNet, MobileNet)
- Deploy on your own cloud server
- Add multilingual support (Hindi, Spanish, etc.)
